# Project: Data Cleaning and Manipulation with Pandas

## Project Description

Using Pandas to clean and manipulate the Data Frame 'GSAF5.csv'.

---

## Hypotheses

There will be irrelevant data present, the presence of multiple NaN values is not criteria enough to drop columns from Data Frame, perhaps there will be vague descriptions included that are not relevant or useful for the understanding of shark attacks.

## Dataset

Dataset = 'GSAF5.csv' 

Original source of dataset: http://www.sharkattackfile.net/index.htm Link to messy dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks/version/1

Description of Dataset: This is a table of shark attack incidents retrieved from the Global Shark Attack File.

## Database

Structure of database given is one table.

## Workflow

For more information and description of each step taken please see the Jupyter Notebook File included.

## Organization

The initial data frame was evaluated and called with head(), then an understanding of the shape() of the data frame was made. The work organization started after a "sketch" of a viable clean table was produced and after this "sketch" was made, the steps in order to achieve the new data frame were listed and followed.
